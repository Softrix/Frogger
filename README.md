frogger
=======

This is a modified version of of Kyles Frogger programming assignment found here:  https://github.com/lanmonster/frogger - this was something I was asked to help with years ago and completely forgot about the code.


	History:

		Rewritten welcome screen to remove external file requirement.
		Rewritten Log code to support different size logs, different colours and speeds.
		Rewritten Car code to support different size cars/trucks, different colours and speeds.
		Optimised code in several areas.
		Fixed several compiler warnings.
		Written Frog->Car collision code

	Todo:
	
		collision with logs = ride with log until move up or down off the log
		test for non collision of logs, i.e. drop in water = 1 less life.
		test for win zones (and all zones completed = win)
		score increase on successful zone.

I never did finish this back then, I hope someone finds the code useful.
