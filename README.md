frogger assignment


This is a remake of the classic game Frogger.

Current issues I am having include getting the cars and logs to move, getting everything to move simultaneously and handling collisions.

The current version has code that makes the logs move across the screen but the frog doesn't move until the cars are done moving.


Edit:  Forked from lanmonster and a lot of improvements / bugs have been implemented - there are still some issues such as when you jump on the logs and ride.  I made these improvements years ago when I was helping Kyle but never ever updated GitHub - oops!
